# Interest-Calculator

Interest Calculator is a simple tkinter GUI that prompts the user for what kind of interest they are accruing. 

After asking questions about the time the interest is building, the number of times interest is compounding per year, and how much money is deposited to start,
it will return the total amount of money in the account over the specified span of time (in years).
